    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mary Berry's tomato soup is quick, easy and delicious. In fact, it is one of her favourite family recipes, as she always have the ingredients in the cupboard. 
    With no onions to chop or tomatoes to skin, it really is ready in ten minutes!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>    6 sun-dried tomatoes in oil</li>
        <li>    2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>    3 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>    500ml/18fl oz chicken or vegetable stock</li>
        <li>    1 tbsp caster sugar</li>
        <li>    150ml/5fl oz full-fat milk</li>
        <li>    150ml/5fl oz double cream</li>
        <li>    salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>    3–4 tsp basil pesto, to serve</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Set a large, deep pan over a medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of oil from the sun-dried tomatoes. Add the garlic and stir-fry for a few seconds, or until it just starts to colour.</li>
        <li>Add the sun-dried and tinned tomatoes, stock and sugar and bring to the boil, stirring constantly. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then cover with a lid, reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and, using a hand blender, blend the soup in the pan. Stir in the milk and cream and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper before heating through on the hob.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with ½ teaspoon basil pesto swirled on the top of each bowl of soup.</li>
    </ol>
